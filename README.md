## Tedle 
A random word is chosen by the random word API. 

Then a user guesses a valid 5 letter word then clicks enter. It is checked by the dictionary API to confirm that the guess is a word. 

After the guess is made if the tile returns grey that letter is not in the word. 

If the tile returns yellow that means the letter is in the word but not in the correct position of the word. 

If the tile is green the letter is in the word and is in the correct position.
